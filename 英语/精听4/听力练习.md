> Picture this

> you are going on a book trip

> and you get on the hore with your family

> and you get your bags

> and the captain comes out to gree you and says ,hi my name's Matina

> I'll be the captain for this journal

> Let's just have a great trip

> Nope, leave me all of these boat

> What we want in that moment, is for the captain to work out and say: 'Hi, My name's Matina xxxx, I'll be your captain for this journey, Let's have a great trip'

> the point is, when you are a speaker, you are the captain for that journey, and how you show up really matters

> for last 17 years, I have coached thousands of speakers all over the world, from big tec companies from small startup,

> and every one from new highers, to ceos 45 hundred companies want to know, how do you show up on the confident

> So I'd like to share my top five tips for how to be confident ,even if you're not

> so Let's break it down,

> what was the difference between those two captains,

> what did you see , what did you hear

> and not just you known, one seemed nerveros, one seemed confident

> but what was them doing differnetly, different valumn, different words, certainly different body language

> but the truth is, I wasn't actually feeling perticalurly confident

> I was just making through it fizical, and xxx choices to make you think that

> you can do that too

> anyone can do this

> so what are those confidences looking choices,

> number one , turn up the energy and speak up

> when you speak up, even just a little bit, it increases a confident,

> you don't have to shout,

> think about this way

> you don't have to shout

> think about this way

> on the scale of one to ten, aim for a five

> yes, it goes to eleven,

> but you can just aim for a five,

> I'm here, at five, right now

> I can break it down three here,

> It sounds prepared, positive, and confident

> So turn up the energy, and speak up

> number two

> pause, like a boss

> nervous speakers tend to speak really fast , right?

>

> however, if you try to speak slowly,

> It sounds like this,

> right,it's not better

> so instead, make xxx pauses.

> Pause in transition, pause for emphasis, pause like a boss

> number three, super hero stands

> image you are a super hero, you can do xx for you chair

> what super hero sit

> yes, let that change your xxx, I see you xxx smile on your face

> and have some better , I can tact

> you can do it from your chair , how was your super hero sit

> yes, let's change your passchair, I see you

> yes, let us bring you a smile to your face

> and have some better I can tact

> all of that reads as confident

> and pretending to be a super hero is just super quit way to have confident looking body language

> now, this one also goes to eleven

> you can just aim for a five, and that will be great talking that case and go save the day

> you can stand the super hero backstage to push your confidence

> but I'm saying , run that super hero stands on stage, so the audience sees you on confident

> and if you need a easy short cut, just make the shape, of the confident person

> the audience can not read your mind, you don't know how your feeling

> so just make the shape, and they will go with it

> if you come over my house for dinner, and I open up the door

> and says Hi, come on in , we are having chiken,

> you do like , oh ,this is a bad time

> you know, you got make a shape of a host, the smile shape, right

4:44

> it's a xxx shape

> open up , Hi welcome , come on in

> if you are not sure, if you are making confident looking choices

> you can just video your self and watch back

> feel that just like what I used to say

> not one not one

> I know most people don't like look themselves

> I got it

> and inviting them in cooking through your siede , doing as much like will be on the day

> wether it's werchable or in person

> and I know it my feel, a little funny

> saying it out aloud to yourself
