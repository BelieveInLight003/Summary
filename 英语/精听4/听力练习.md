> Picture this

> you are going on a boot trip  
**boat trip**

> and you get on the hore with your family. 
**get on board**

> and you got your bags

> and the captain comes out to greet you and says ,hi my name's Matina

> I'll be your captain for this journey

> Let's just have a great trip

> Nope, leave me all of these boat. 
**get me off this boat**

> What we want in that moment, is for the captain to work out and say: 'Hi, My name's Matina, I'll be your captain for this journey, Let's have a great trip'

> the point is, when you are the speaker, you are the captain for that journey, and how you show up really matters

> for the last 17 years, I have coached thousands of speakers all over the world, from big tec companies to small startups,  
**tech**

> and every one from new highers, to ceos, a 45 hundred companies want to know, how do you show up and look confident. 
**new hires**
**to CEOs of Fortune 500 companies**

> So I'd like to share my top five tips for how to be confident ,even if you're not

> so Let's break it down,

> what was the difference between those two captains,

> what did you see , what did you hear

> and not just you known, one seemed nerveros, one seemed confident

> but what was I doing differnetly to make you think that, different valumn, different words, certainly different body language. 
**volume**


> but the truth is, I wasn't actually feeling perticalurly confident.  
**particularly**

> I was just making through it fiziacal, and xxx choices to make you think that.   
**physical**
**vocal choices**

> you can do that too

> anyone can do this

> so what are those confident looking choices,

> number one , turn up the energy and speak up

> when you speak up, even just a little bit, it rids a confident,  
**it reads as confident**

> you don't have to shout,

> think about this way

> on the scale of one to ten, aim for a five

> yes, it goes to eleven,

> but you can just aim for a five,

> I'm here, at five, right now

> I can break it in better down three here,  
**I can bring it back down to a three here**

**And we bring it backk up to a five**. 

> It sounds prepared, positive, and confident

> So turn up the energy, and speak up

> number two

> pause, like a boss

> nervous speakers tend to speak really fast , right?

> \*\*\* lend them when they do have positive and verble feeler likes.  
**And when they do have a pause, they fill it in with verbal filler, like and ums**

> however, if you try to speak more slowly,

> It sounds like this,

> right,it's not better

> so instead, make xxx pauses.  
**strategic**

> Pause in transition, pause for emphasis, pause like a boss

> number three, super hero stands. 
**stance**

> image you are a super hero, you can do it form you chair

> how would a super hero sit

> yes, let that change your passchair, I see you,  
**change your posture**

> let that bring a smile to your face

> and have some better , I can tact,  
**eye contact**

> all of that reads as confident

> and pretending to be a super hero is just a super quit way to have confident looking body language. 
**quick way**

> now, this one also goes to eleven

> you can just aim for a five, and that will be great,

> talking that cape and go save the day
**Tuck in that cape**

> and you can stand the super hero backstage to push your confidence.  
**boost**

> but I'm saying , run that super hero stands on stage,
**bring that superhero stance**

> so your audience sees you as confident

> and if you need an easy short cut, just make the shape, of the confident person

> the audience can not read your mind, they don't know how your feeling

> so just make the shape, and they will go with it

> if you come over my house for dinner, and I open up the door

> and I was like, Hi, come on in , we are having chiken,  
**chicken**

> you woule be like , oh ,this is a bad time

> you know, you got make a shape of a good host, make the smile shape, right

> it's a xxx shape. 
**instead of crossed arm shape**

> open up , Hi welcome , come on in

> if you are not sure, if you are making confident looking choices

> you can just video yourself and watch it back

> feel that just like what I used to say.  
**I feel like I just saw you say**

> not one not one. 
**not doing that one**

> I know most people don't like to watch themselves

> I get it

> What you rather make that adjustment before in front of your audience. 
**but wouldn't you rather make that adjustment before you're in front of your audiences**

> yes videoing your self is a great way to check in to see that doing your taxnics. 
**techniques**

> also to see that, it's often didgree with you,  
**it;s still authentically you**

> your version of confident captain

> now how can you do all these things on performance day

> number four practice with purpose

------5:35
> so make yourself xxxx skaschules, put in your calendar. 
**rehearsal schedule**

> you can give yourself a little trip, when you do a run through

> and then make practice with purpose

> by giving yourself a specific goal and learning one new captain tacnic each day

> It's aweak before you revent

> aim to run it all the way through at least once a day

> if you don't have time for one through

> just take opening, closing, running that three times in a role from anywhere

> when you are in a shower, when you walk your dog, when you make a meal for your kids

> I know my kids are very used to be walking around in the house , talking to myself

> whatever you need to do, take in those reptations

> and don't be afraid of over practice

> don't let that stop you

> you can just let go of your xxxx script and from

> starting your son rebotic

> and you still use , you know book, point, speaker notes , to remind yourself for what would you like to say

> and to Invite you to say a little bit differently each time to keep your fresh

> and let me be clear, by practice, I'm in standing up , saying it out aloud, imaging in your audiences

> and inviting them in cooking through your side , doing as much like will be on the day

> wether it's reachble or in person

> and I know it my feel, a little funny

> saying it out aloud to yourself

> but think about when you learn a new sport

> or when you pratical a new musical instrument

> if you had a piano cancer on Friday.

> and you got a new music on Monday.

> would you only read your music everyday.

> and then play for the very first time at the cancer on Firday

> no way.

> and yes. I see speakers do this all the time

> give yourself a chance.

> practice helps everything.

> and you can really bost your confidence to pratice with purpose.

> by learning one new tecnic each day.

> ok those for tecnics their are. about how to appear confident.

> regardless how your feeling.

> about one more tacbic for you.

> and that's the big one.

> but this is real jam and it's one make all the other shine.

> this is number five

> the slient sentence.

> this is about what you choose to tell yourself.

> I have been a prefesssion actor since I was a kid

> and I had always loved going on stage as an actor as an speaker as an emss.

> and at the same time. I have often been xxx neverous sometimes.

> down right terrfied to set upon stage.

> I'm shaking ,i'm sweading

> what I thinking , what do I do for myself

> and always unhelpful voices speading, just try to make a stop push the way

> and of course ,never worked.

> and I kept going on stage because I love it.

> and years later.

> when I became a speaker coach.

> I got aks to do these prefessional prezentions

> and I stil have noway to deal.

> with that mess of ehzaitity.

> and I was like what can I do.

> and I thought, well ,what do I telling myself.

> what do you mess up, It better be perfect

> I realized, I was giving myself an impossible instruction to be perfect

> and that really was not working

> but what work , what will be a better message.

> and to figer that out , I have to go back to skare one like what do I want.

> why did I say yes to this speaking gig.

> what was my deep purpose here.

> and I realized, hard of it.

> I just want to help my audiences to the best of my ability

> and when I said that , I noticed everything change.

> now that's which I found my first slient sentence.

> I want to help my audience to the best of my ablity

> when I said it even sliently to myself, it act like this over rights switch

> and I was shaking and sweading

> but new I have this higher goal this deeper pourpose

> and everything align to that, that became my highest priority.

> I want to help you and now that thought replace those helpful thoughts.

> everything win better in my performance.

> and I was like yes, it worked.

> and in that way.

> how do I do this every time.

> espcasilly, when xxx stakes in your high.

> and it downed on me.

> if I'm riding, and crafting the words I say out aloud

> why not ride and craft the words I say sliently to myself.

> putting in the screaft, it's in the slient part of this craft.

> so now, every time I reverse.

> every time I walk onto the stage.

> every time I enjoy the vertual meeting.

> I see the following new xxx and evloved slient sentences

> I invite you to be here with me.

> while I'm here with you.

> so that I can make this easier for you.

> now that invitation. to myself to be present.

> that's my defination of stage presents being present

> and that invitation to the audience, to be my partener

> that reminds me these are friends not phones.

> and i'm choosing to be here.

> and now I'm not just making the shape of good host, I'm really, I'm a good host

> because I'm generally welcoming you to my world

> now how do you go about finding your slient sentences

> what do you want

> what's your deep pourpose

> you could be like me , and you just want to help people

> or you could be something more special,

> for example, you might want at least one person in your audience to walk out,and take a cbr class

> or maybe you just super excited to have this experience

> or share with them some cool solutions you have for their problem

> you get to fill the blank

> and decide what you want to complish

> and this is not about graduating to some higher never known being where you never again feel nervous

> I know I havn't , I was feeling pretty big about fifty mintues ago

> getting ready working on stage, and I am

> and probably always will be a recovering professionest

> that is a real warm passway in my brain

> It is ,there exits, can not be awasted

> but now , I have this other passway

> and when big moments like this come up

> I get to choose

> and that's what was I doing back there in wins

> I was choosing to generally insist on repeating my slient sentences to set meself up for success

> what we tell ourselves really matters

> we follow our instructions all day long

> and whole selves are always listening

> so when you notice something is going well , or your feeling something might not go well in the future

> use this checklist, what do I telling myself, waht's been broadcast

> then repleace that with a better sentence

> to help set you up for where you like to go

> and most importantly, put it in the script , practice it just as much as words you say out aloud

> and if you're running your aontrol in a shower three times in a role

> you will go slient be, out aloud be, slient, aloud,

> until it is inextremely linked

> and it is just a part of your process

> and it is repeatable and realizable

> and it's just there for me when you need it

> now I want to leave you with this final thought

> when you are at home and you practice some these tacnics like turn up the energe and speak aloud , pause like a boss

> super hero stands , practice with pourpose and your slient sentences

> please know, if I'm in unfortable at first, because it's new and that is normal

> but think back to when I was daming strating the neverous captain at the top,

> how do that making the feel

> and when the confident captain came out ,

> oh what a relief

> oh , I can just sit back, and join the ride ,

> remember that feeling of safty you had as a audience member,

> and bring that into your next versial

> you can give that gift to your audience

> reach outside your comfort zone and make your audience feel safe

> by making the choices of a confident captain and who knows

> you might even have fun

> have a great trip
