### Secret of self control  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTb3d5cjSFI


my mom was 42 years old, when I was born.

And she started exercising for the first time in her life.

She started by running around the volog

And then, she started doing five key rases.

And then, she started doing ten key rases.

And then, she ran a maring phone

And after that, my mom did it twice a log.

By the time, she was fifty seven years old.

My mom was tracking up a hill, to the base camp of mountin rist.

And let me tell you about my dad.

When I was a kid, my dad used to take me science classes.

He was also my calkulate teacher in high school.

I want to cro under the desk.

I learn some important from my mom.

The value of health.

And I learn something important from my dad.

The value of science.

And these two values have guided me on my track through life.

And they help me appreciate another ecdemic where officing.

And it is not in bowl.

Instead, it is optimitic of healthy living.

I have building people worldwide or on bees.

And you would think, that fifty years after first US suport the  xxx on the dangerous of tabaco was published.

That we would be beyond probely smoking.

Today, a billion people worldwide use tobaco.

Tobaco and obisity, are the two  most xxx reasons of crimature daff.

Suburn use problems, if like try to solve reject poso.

We engae an help on healthy behaivers because of our jenatics.

Because  of our genatics, because berave of transmitters, because of xxx ,such as peers and medium.

Each of those pieces of parse, are not the things that you and I,can solve on our own.

But there is one piece of parso, that help the key, are choices.

But what we do, with our ciricess to engaed the addictive behaviors, like smoking or over eating, are choices.

There is a new science, of self control, may help the kid to xxx the optimatics.

It's called willingness.

Willingness means allowing your xxxx to come and to go, but not acting them by smoking or eating on healthy.

But, actually, I am not talking about will power, 
not talking about power through your xxx.

Instead, I am talking about different notion xxx.

Looks like this, dropping the struggle, with your creavings, opening out them, letting them be there.

And makeing peace with them.

Now this point maybe very skechule.

I was,when I first turned about year ago.

A friend of mime, came to me , with a book,on living this.

He said, Johnson, this books will change your life, forever.

And I said, oh, ok,yeah, I will check it out.

So, I, I went through it.

So much sackle buble.

xxx. xxxx

Until, some years later.
 
My wife brought me to work shopp xxx in university in Waston.

And I was below away.

So I read the book, and I read a lot of books on willingness.

And I get trained in it.

And what I learned  was a willingness,is a part of exceptence.

In exceptence of  commitment  approached here to be changed.

It is abrot approached to be here to be changed in use , to help people with inside the soilder source,   addictions, even something invited 
companies  are now using it to help improve their employee's performance and reduce their stress.

Now to understand why I was belong away, you have to understand the word I live in.

In my research world, a common way you help people quote smoking lose way, is you teach some tool avoid their cxxx.

Avoid thinking about smoking.

Distract yourself from full creways.

There's a song, from xxx shown,  caches the xxx prefectly.

It goes like this, when you started to get confused because force your head, don't feel lose feelings, hold the meanings instead,
turn it off, like a like which just go quick.We do it all the time. When you feel third feelings that don't seem right. Treat those past feelings like reading a light. And turn them off.

We all live in this world, the song we hear is taking off the bad feelings.

Now, let's take a look at these cookies.

They just came out the xxx , all  here so good. They are so delicious.

--------------------- 7 12
Just feel the cxxx tea. They are lovly, so good.

Now turn it off.

You want those cookies more now ,right?

You see the xxx, you try to turn it off, you can't turn it off.

Maybe, you don't have to.

Maybe, you can leave the live on.

Here's how.

My reasearch xxx  xxx   cancer rexxx conceiler.

Here's young.

He's conducting xxx trails. To see ,if showing people how to xx craving thire xxx , is facting xxx smoking.

We are conducting trails or face to face interventions, and a telphone quote smoking on lines, and website called webbook doctor work.

And in the app, called smart quite.

These technologies hell the petional, to reach millions of peolple, with their ventions, that could save their lives.

That's pretty amazing.

And we tell you about data, when you pull togther the source from six xx  trails, or six that have been publish today,
concluding trails by their callings.

What we see, is that from people who were asigned to avoid the aventional, 
avoiding the crevens.

Some of them quite smoking, and very depend on the study.

However, for the people who were rarely sign to the rxxx condition, twice, is many, quite smoking.

Very very encrege.

Now, of course,the data only tell us one small part of story.

So, to help you see,  rolling is an action, I'm not wave togther experience I have cosaling people,  quite smoking.
