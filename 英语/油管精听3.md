my mom was 42 years old, when I was born.

And she started exercising for the first time in her life.

She started by running around the volog

And then, she started doing five key cases.

And then, she started doing ten key resons.

And then, she started doing maring phone

And after that, my mom doing trff xxxx

By the time, she was fifty seven years old.

My mom was xxx a kill, to the base camp of xxx rist

And let me tell you about my dad.

When I was a kid, my dad used to take me science classes.

He was also my calkulate teacher in high school.

I want to cro under the desk.

I learn some important from my mom.

The value of health.

And I learn something important from my dad.

The value of science.

And these two values gotted me through my xxx life.

And imxxx me where my xxx officing.

And not in below.

Instead, it is optimitic in health living.

I have building people worldwide or on bees.

And you would think, that fifty years after the US first suport the  xxx on the dangerous of tabaco was published.

That we be beyond smoking.

Today, a billion people worldwide use tobaco.

Tobaco and obisity, are the two xxx xx 
of crimature daff.

Suburn use problems, if like try to solve reject poso.

We engae an help on behaivers because of our jenatics.

Because  of our genatics, because berave of transmitters, because of xxx ,such as peers and medium.

Each of those pieces of parse, are not the things that you and I,can solve on our own.

But there is one piece of parso, that may for the kid, are choices.

But what we do, with our ciricess to engaed the behaviors, like smoking or over eating, are choices.

There is a new science, of self control, may help the
key to xxx the optimatics.

It is called willingness.

Willingness means allowing your xxxx to come and to go, but not acting them by smoking or eating on healthy.

But, actually, I am not talking about will power, 
not talking about power xxx xxx.

Instead, I am talking about different notion xxx.

Looks like this, dropping the struggle, with your creavings, opening out them, letting them be there.

And makeing peace with them.

Now the point maybe critical.

I was,when I first xxx year ago.

A friend of mime, came to me , with a book,on living this.

He said, Joson, this books will change your life, forever.

And I said, oh, ok,yeah, I will check it out.

So, I, I went through it.

I xxx like sackle buble.

Until, some years later.
 
My wife brought me to work shopp xxx in university in Waston.

And I was below away.

So I read the book, and I read a lot of books on willingness.

And I get trained in it.

And waht I learned  was a willingness,is a part of exceptence.
