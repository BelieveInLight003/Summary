About we do, with our ciricess to engaed the addictive behaviors, like smoking or over eating, are choices.

There is a new science, of self control, may help the kid to reversing these epdemics.

It's called willingness.

Willingness means allowing your xxxx to come and to go, but not acting them by smoking or eating unhealthy.

But, actually, I am not talking about will power, and I'm not talking about power through your xxx.

Instead, I am talking about different notion xxx.

Looks like this, dropping the struggle, with your creavings, opening out them, letting them be there.

And making peace with them.

Now this point maybe very skechule.

I was,when I first turned about year ago.

A friend of mine, came to me , with a book,on living this.

He said, Johnson, this book will change your life, forever.

And I said, oh, ok, yeah, I'll check it out.

So, I, I went through it.

So much sackle buble.

xxx. xxxx

Until, some years later.
 
My wife brought me to work shopp xxx in university in Washington.

And I was below away.

So I read the book, and I read a lot of books on willingness.

And I get trained in it.

And what I learned  was a willingness,is a part of exceptence.

5:00
In the exceptence and commitment xxxxx approached here to be changed.

It is abrot approached to be here to be changed in use , to help people with inside the soilder source,   addictions, even something invited 
companies  are now using it to help improve their employee's performance and reduce their stress.

Now to understand why I was belong away, you have to understand the word I live in.

In my research world, a common way you help people quote smoking lose way, is you teach some tool avoid their cxxx.

Avoid thinking about smoking.

Distract yourself from full creways.

There's a song, from xxx shown,  caches this prefectly.

It goes like this, when you started to get confused because focus your head, don't feel lose feelings, hold the meanings instead,
turn it off, like a like which just go quick.We do it all the time. When you feel third feelings that don't seem right. Treat those past feelings like reading a light. And turn them off.

We all live in this world, where the song we keep hearing is turning off the bad feelings.

Now, let's take a look at these cookies.

They just came out the xxx, a, they are so good. They are so delicious.

Just feel that cxxx tea, those cookies. They are lovely, so good.

Now turn it off.

You want those cookies more now ,right?

You see the xxx, you try to turn it off, you can't turn it off.

Maybe, you don't have to.

Maybe, you can leave the live on.

Here's how.

My research xxx  xxx   cancer rexxx conceiler.

Here's youngnal. 

He's conducting when ice couldn't  trails. To see ,if showing people how to xx craving thire xxx , is factive  quiting smoking.

We are conducting trails or face to face interventions, and a telephone quote smoking hard lines, and website called web quite doctor work.

And in the app, called smart quite.

These technologies hell the petencional, to reach millions of peolple, with their ventions, that could save their lives.

That's pretty amazing.

And we tell you about data, when you pull togther the source from six xx  trails, or six that have been publish today,
concluding trails conducting by their callings.

What we see, is that for people who were asigned to avoid the aventional, 
avoiding the crevens.

Some of them quite smoking, and very depending on the study.

However, for the people who were rarely asign to the willingness condition, twice, is many, quite smoking.

Very very encreging.

Now, of course,the data only tell us one small part of story.

So, to help you see,  rollingness is an action, I'm not wave together experience I have consulting people, from quite smoking.

And all together, refer, to the must one person, we just called Jane.
