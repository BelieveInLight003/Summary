### Secret of self control  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTb3d5cjSFI

my mom was 42 years old, when I was born.

And she started exercising for the first time in her life.

She started by running around the volog

And then, she started doing five key cases.

And then, she started doing ten key resons.

And then, she started doing maring phone

And after that, my mom doing trff xxxx

By the time, she was fifty seven years old.

My mom was xxx a kill, to the base camp of xxx rist

And let me tell you about my dad.

When I was a kid, my dad used to take me science classes.

He was also my calkulate teacher in high school.

I want to cro under the desk.

I learn some important from my mom.

The value of health.

And I learn something important from my dad.

The value of science.

And these two values gotted me through my xxx life.

And imxxx me where my xxx officing.

And not in below.

Instead, it is optimitic in health living.

I have building people worldwide or on bees.

And you would think, that fifty years after the US first suport the  xxx on the dangerous of tabaco was published.

That we be beyond smoking.

Today, a billion people worldwide use tobaco.

Tobaco and obisity, are the two xxx xx 
of crimature daff.

Suburn use problems, if like try to solve reject poso.

We engae an help on behaivers because of our jenatics.

Because  of our genatics, because berave of transmitters, because of xxx ,such as peers and medium.

Each of those pieces of parse, are not the things that you and I,can solve on our own.

But there is one piece of parso, that may for the kid, are choices.

But what we do, with our ciricess to engaed the behaviors, like smoking or over eating, are choices.

There is a new science, of self control, may help the
key to xxx the optimatics.

It is called willingness.

Willingness means allowing your xxxx to come and to go, but not acting them by smoking or eating on healthy.

But, actually, I am not talking about will power, 
not talking about power xxx xxx.

Instead, I am talking about different notion xxx.

Looks like this, dropping the struggle, with your creavings, opening out them, letting them be there.

And makeing peace with them.

Now the point maybe critical.

I was,when I first xxx year ago.

A friend of mime, came to me , with a book,on living this.

He said, Joson, this books will change your life, forever.

And I said, oh, ok,yeah, I will check it out.

So, I, I went through it.

I xxx like sackle buble.

xxx. xxxx

Until, some years later.
 
My wife brought me to work shopp xxx in university in Waston.

And I was below away.

So I read the book, and I read a lot of books on willingness.

And I get trained in it.

And what I learned  was a willingness,is a part of exceptence.

In exceptence of xxxxxx.

It is abrot approached to be here to be changed in use , to help people with inside the soilder source,   addictions, even something invited 
companies  are now using it to help improve behaviors to performance and reduce their stress.

Now to understand why I was belong away, you have to understand the world I live in.

In my research world, a common way you help people quote smoking lose way, is teach some tool  avoid their cxxx.

Avoid thinking about smoking.

Distract yourself from xxx creways.

There's a song, from xxx shown,  caches the xxx prefectly.

It goes like this, when you started to get confused because force your head, don't feel lose feelings, hold the xxx instead,
turn it off, like xx which just go quick.We do it all the time. When you feel third feelings that don't seem right. Treat those past feelings like 
reading like. And turn them off.

We all live in this world, the song we hear is taking off the bad feelings.

Now, let's take a look at these cookies.

They just came out the xxx , all  here so good. They are so delicious.

Just feel the cxxx tea. They are lovly, so good.

Now turn it off.

You want those xxx xxx ,right?

You see the xxx, you try to turn it off, you can't turn off.

Maybe, you don't have to.

Maybe, you can leave the live on.

Here's how.

My reasearch xxx  xxx   cancer rexxx conceiler.

Here's young.

He's conducting xxx trails. To see ,if showing people how to xx craving thire xxx , is facting xxx smoking.

We are conducting trails or face to face interventions, and a telphone quote smoking on lines, and website called webbook doctor work.

And in the app, called smart quite.

These technologies hell the petional, to reach millions of peolple, with their ventions, that could save their lives.

That's pretty amazing.

And we tell you about data, when you pull togther the source from six xx  trails, or six that have been publish today,
concluding trails by their callings.

What we see, is that from people who were asigned to avoid the aventional, 
avoiding the crevens.

Some of them quite smoking, and very depend on the study.

However, for the people who were rarely sign to the rxxx condition, twice, is many, quite smoking.

Very very encrege.

Now, of course,the data only tell us one small part of story.

So, to help you see,  rolling is an action, I'm not wave togther experience I have cosaling people,  quite smoking.
