Each of those pieces of parse, are not the things that you and I,can solve on our own.

But there is one piece of parso, that may for the kid, are choices.

But what we do, with our ciricess to engaed the behaviors, like smoking or over eating, are choices.

There is a new science, of self control, may help the
key to xxx the optimatics.

It is called willingness.

Willingness means allowing your xxxx to come and to go, but not acting them by smoking or eating on healthy.

But, actually, I am not talking about will power, 
not talking about power xxx xxx.

Instead, I am talking about different notion xxx.

Looks like this, dropping the struggle, with your creavings, opening out them, letting them be there.

And makeing peace with them.

Now the point maybe critical.

I was,when I first xxx year ago.

A friend of mime, came to me , with a book,on living this.

He said, Joson, this books will change your life, forever.

And I said, oh, ok,yeah, I will check it out.

So, I, I went through it.

I xxx like sackle buble.

xxx. xxxx

Until, some years later.
 
My wife brought me to work shopp xxx in university in Waston.

And I was below away.

So I read the book, and I read a lot of books on willingness.

And I get trained in it.

And what I learned  was a willingness,is a part of exceptence.

5:00
In exceptence of xxxxxx.

It is abrot approached to be here to be changed in use , to help people with inside the soilder source,   addictions, even something invited 
companies  are now using it to help improve behaviors to performance and reduce their stress.

Now to understand why I was belong away, you have to understand the world I live in.

In my research world, a common way you help people quote smoking lose way, is teach some tool  avoid their cxxx.

Avoid thinking about smoking.

Distract yourself from xxx creways.

There's a song, from xxx shown,  caches the xxx prefectly.

It goes like this, when you started to get confused because force your head, don't feel lose feelings, hold the xxx instead,
turn it off, like xx which just go quick.We do it all the time. When you feel third feelings that don't seem right. Treat those past feelings like 
reading like. And turn them off.

We all live in this world, the song we hear is taking off the bad feelings.

Now, let's take a look at these cookies.

They just came out the xxx , all  here so good. They are so delicious.

Just feel the cxxx tea. They are lovly, so good.

Now turn it off.

You want those xxx xxx ,right?

You see the xxx, you try to turn it off, you can't turn off.

Maybe, you don't have to.

Maybe, you can leave the live on.

Here's how.

My reasearch xxx  xxx   cancer rexxx conceiler.

Here's young.

He's conducting xxx trails. To see ,if showing people how to xx craving thire xxx , is facting xxx smoking.

We are conducting trails or face to face interventions, and a telphone quote smoking on lines, and website called webbook doctor work.

And in the app, called smart quite.

These technologies hell the petional, to reach millions of peolple, with their ventions, that could save their lives.

That's pretty amazing.

And we tell you about data, when you pull togther the source from six xx  trails, or six that have been publish today,
concluding trails by their callings.

What we see, is that from people who were asigned to avoid the aventional, 
avoiding the crevens.

Some of them quite smoking, and very depend on the study.

However, for the people who were rarely sign to the rxxx condition, twice, is many, quite smoking.

Very very encrege.

Now, of course,the data only tell us one small part of story.

So, to help you see,  rolling is an action, I'm not wave togther experience I have cosaling people,  quite smoking.

8：50
And all togther, reffer, to the must one person, we just called Jane,

So as typical, people who came in, wants help to quite smoking, Jane said 45 year old person, who started smoking was tenager.

She tried to quite smoking several times,  was not successful. 

So she was very snapcal, when I said xxx to get help for her to quite.

And she was very helpful, this time will be different.

So the fisrt thing that I showed Jane, was to be willing does to be ware of her xxx of her body.

So to notice, we saw xxx within in her body.

And when I did this, I aksed her xxx bad,  and just 
xxx xxx of her own time.

And say she if smoke afterawards.

And explain this, she stoped, she says, what are you talking about.

I don't have creaviness.

I just smoke.

So I said, well, when I tried, we will see what happens, and it doesn't work, I'll try something else.

So, she came back, we player, she said, you known, 
I had been traking my previce.I have been traking them all the time.

And now ,I can't stop about aginst smoking.

What am I supposed to do?

Well, right of you ,my answer, Let's behind the things.

Now it's probably going on here, we said Jane has benn cxxx all along.

And like a lot of us, she was living on out of poplit.

He waked up in the morning, smoked a singrete,  he had a cup of coffee, smoked a sigrete, begin the car, you smoke a sigret.

We often just not aware of what we think and what we feel brfore we act.  

So I answer Jane, what to be willing.

And one of the way, we should do that, was an exercise called I have a fought.

So one of Jane thoughts, before she had a sigret,  was  I feeling out of stressed right now  I really need a sigret.

So I ansered the add frese, I'm having a thought.

Like this, I'm having a thought, I'm feeling out of stressed right now,  I really need a sigret.

Then I answered the ted fress, I notice I have a thought.

So I'm noticing,that I;m having a thought, then I full of stessed and I really need a sigret.

Now we can all do exercise like this, when we have nagtive thought, like my thought.

I'm boring, I xxx by talk.

And I'm having a log, I'm xxx of you of my talk.

So what does exercise did.

It give me a little space between me and my thoughts.

And it's in that space, that I can choose not to run put of fifty handrd people.

And the fact is we don't act on every thought we have ,because  if we did, we all be in whole of travel.

So is what help for Jane.

But there was something else, that was really diffcult. 

For Jane, I thought a lot of compassion for her about it.

And I was the judgement that is xx for people, when he would be outside for a sigrette.

Then cxxx for her husband, for being a smoker.

And self loading, she developed about smoking.

And she done with shame, by having a sigrette, which gave her xxx until shame came back.

So I said to Jane, what will be like, if you try to honor, this feeling of shame, as a part of humani experience.

If you had a close friend, who was feeling shame about smoking, I said to Jane, what will you offer to this friend, as a words of caring and kindness.

And could you then offer those of words, do your self Jane.

Ans she looked up, and she had this look, of this tempory resxx.

From shame, which make it a lit bit easier next time.

Not act on the cxx.

So here is the secret of self control, the secret deserve control, is to give up control.

Because otherwise, we get into xxx, with a monster, 
a creaving monster.

And creaing monster says, come on, smoke a sigrette, 
come on, have that cookie.

And you hear the other sound, no, creaving monster, I'm in control of myself.

The cxx monster says, no, no ,you want it.

And you just back here, you are going back and force ,back and force.

And pretty soon, the monster crea out of power of you, you have that cookie ,you have a sigrette.

And so the ccxxx monster come back, and you on the xx of war again, doing what we learn how to do.

And less ,and less ,you droft the rope.

And when you discover, if you  just allow the monster to be ,to accupid the space in your body, you will discover in afew mintues the cxx monster is not xxx as appreas, and sometimes even goes away.


As we break for lunch , we gona have choice what we eat.

When you see them, try to be aware of xxx of your body,try to be willing to have those cxx seeings, 
pass on their own.

And whatever choice you make, try to be experience 
a xx of caring and kindness to yourself,  for that of mountain that we are clmbing.
